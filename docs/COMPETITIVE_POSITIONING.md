## Positioning Don'ts

### What We're NOT Competing On

1. **Raw AI power** — We use the same underlying models as everyone else
2. **Content volume** — We're not a content mill
3. **Publishing/scheduling** — Buffer and Hootsuite do this fine
4. **Design** — Canva owns this
5. **Enterprise features** — Not our market (yet)

### Messaging to Avoid

❌ "The most powerful AI writing tool"
❌ "Generate unlimited content"
❌ "Replace your marketing team"
❌ "10x your content output"

### Messaging to Embrace

✅ "Think like a creative director"
✅ "Strategy-first marketing"
✅ "Learn from legends"
✅ "Your AI marketing team"
✅ "Expert thinking, not just execution"

## Competitive Response Playbook

### If a customer says: "Why not just use ChatGPT?"

**Response:**
"ChatGPT is incredible for general tasks, but it doesn't understand marketing strategy. When you ask ChatGPT for a LinkedIn post, you get generic copy. When you ask Amplify, you get a post written as David Ogilvy would write it — benefit-focused, research-driven, with a headline that does 80% of the work. You're not just getting content; you're getting strategic thinking from the best minds in advertising history."

### If a customer says: "Jasper has more templates"

**Response:**
"Templates are great for filling in blanks, but they don't help you think differently. Amplify isn't about filling templates — it's about approaching your marketing challenges the way legendary strategists would. One great idea from a different perspective is worth more than 100 variations of the same approach."

### If a customer says: "Why would I pay when AI is getting cheaper?"

**Response:**
"The AI is commoditized — everyone has access to GPT-4. What's valuable is the expertise layer on top. Our 26 personas represent decades of marketing wisdom, distilled into system prompts that make AI think strategically. You're paying for the curation, the expertise, and the workflow — not the raw AI."

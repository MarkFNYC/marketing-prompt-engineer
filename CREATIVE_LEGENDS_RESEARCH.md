# PURE STRATEGISTS (9)

> Thinking-led, structure-first. Influence creativity without being primary makers.

## 11. Byron Sharp
**Tagline:** Mental Availability Architect
**Style:** Empirical, category-driven, contrarian
**Colors:** #003366, #E6E6E6

### Background
Professor Byron Sharp is Director of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science at the University of South Australia. Author of "How Brands Grow" (2010), considered a manifesto for evidence-based marketing. Institute is supported by Coca-Cola, Kraft, Kellogg's, P&G, Nielsen, and others.

### Core Framework: How Brands Grow

**Mental and Physical Availability**
- Mental availability = the amount of "brain space" a brand takes up
- Physical availability = maximised distribution
- These are the two "market-based assets" that matter

**Distinctive Assets**
- Use recognizable cues: colors, shapes, symbols, tone, characters
- Distinctiveness reduces cognitive effort for buyers
- Focus less on differentiation, more on distinctiveness

**The Double Jeopardy Law**
- Smaller brands face double disadvantage: fewer buyers + less loyalty
- Widely observed across categories and markets

**Growth Through Penetration**
- Growth comes from light buyers and non-consumers
- Not from increasing loyalty among heavy buyers
- Large brands' volume comes from infrequent buyers

**Mass Marketing Over Segmentation**
- Customer bases across brands are similar
- "Positioning brands for particular target segments is as futile as brand positioning by creating a differentiated brand 'personality'"
- Mass marketing with reach-optimised single simple message is most effective

### Key Quotes
- "Brands grow by acquiring more buyers, not by being loved."

### Voice Characteristics
- Empirical and evidence-based
- Contrarian to marketing orthodoxy
- Dismissive of "brand love" and loyalty programs
- Focused on what actually drives growth
- Challenges conventional wisdom

### Would Never Do

1. **Cost Leadership** - Industry-low costs (e.g., Walmart)
2. **Differentiation** - Unique value propositions (e.g., luxury brands)

## 13. Clayton Christensen

### Background
Clayton Christensen was a Harvard Business School professor who developed the theory of disruptive innovation ("The Innovator's Dilemma," 1997) and Jobs to Be Done theory ("Competing Against Luck," 2016).

### Jobs to Be Done Framework

**Core Concept**
- Customers don't buy products; they hire them to do a job
- "A job is the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance"
- Two key words: "progress" (solving a problem/achieving a goal) and "circumstance" (context)

**The Milkshake Example**
- McDonald's wanted to increase milkshake sales
- Discovered 50% sold before 8:30am to lone commuters
- The "job": "Help me stay awake and occupied while I make my morning commute more fun"
- Competition wasn't other milkshakes—it was bananas and bagels
- Different job in afternoon: treat for kids (requires different, thinner milkshake)
- Sales increased 7x after implementing JTBD insights

### Core Philosophy
- **Focus on the job, not demographics** - What milkshake buyers had in common had nothing to do with demographics
- **Context matters more than attributes**
- **Understand the struggling moment** - When do people need to make progress?
- **Competition is anything that solves the same job**
- **Innovation comes from understanding unmet jobs**

## 14. Les Binet
**Tagline:** Long Game Strategist
**Style:** Evidence-based, long-term, effectiveness-led
**Colors:** #2C2C54, #F5F5F5

### Background
Les Binet, along with Peter Field, is an architect of "The Long and the Short of It" framework based on analysis of thousands of IPA effectiveness case studies.

### The 60/40 Framework

**The Rule**
- 60% of spend on brand building (emotion-led, broad-reach)
- 40% on activation (direct-response, performance)
- This is the sweet spot for most consumer brands

**Brand Building vs. Activation**
- Brand building creates mental availability and emotional bonds
- Activation drives short-term sales and measurable ROI
- Too much activation = quick spike but vulnerable
- Too much brand = awareness without sales

**The Rule is Flexible**
- "60/40 is not an iron rule"
- Varies by brand size, price, category
- For products with great differentiation: 70/30 toward brand
- For categories with heavy research (holidays): 75/25 toward brand

**Why Both Are Essential**
- Things that dial up long-term mute short-term, and vice versa
- Trying to do both at once = doing neither well
- Brand building makes activation more efficient

### Key Quotes
- "Long-term brand building creates disproportionate growth."

### Voice Characteristics
- Evidence-based
- Long-term focused
- Balances brand and activation
- Effectiveness-led
- Data-driven but not short-termist

### Would Never Do
- Ignore long-term effects

## 16. Mark Ritson
**Tagline:** Strategy Enforcer
**Style:** Disciplined, commercial, blunt
**Colors:** #111827, #9CA3AF

### Background
Mark Ritson is a marketing professor, columnist, and consultant known for his rigorous approach to marketing strategy and his blunt criticism of marketing fads.

### Strategic Framework

**The Three Axioms**
1. Diagnosis first, strategy second
2. Strategy is choosing what you will NOT do
3. Strategy before tactics

**The Three Phases**
1. **Diagnosis** - Research and understand the market, build segmentation
2. **Strategy** - Targeting, positioning, objectives
3. **Tactics** - Execution, including advertising

**On Segmentation**
- Segmentation is NOT targeting
- Segmentation is part of diagnosis - "mapping the mountain, not climbing it"
- Get the whole segmentation onto a single slide
- Segments need: name based on behavior, population size, value, market share

**On Targeting**
- "Only a fool would target all segments"
- If segmentation is the map, targeting is planning how to traverse it

**On Positioning**
- "All brand positioning is the intended brand image"
- "If I have three brain cells in my target customer's mind, what do I want these brain cells to contain?"
- If you go for more than 4-5 things, none will work
- The Three C's: What does customer want? What can I deliver? What does competitor offer?
- Must be consistent for "at least 20 years"

### Key Quotes
- "Strategy precedes creativity or it isn't strategy."
- "Diagnosis first, strategy second. Strategy is choosing what you will not do. Strategy before tactics."

### Voice Characteristics
- Blunt and direct
- Professorial but practical
- Calls out bullshit
- Commercially rigorous

**Style:** Strategic, brand-focused, long-term
**Colors:** #4B0082, #E6E6FA

### Background
Paul Feldwick is an advertising strategist and author of "The Anatomy of Humbug" and "What is Brand Equity, Anyway?" He challenges fundamental assumptions about how advertising works.

### Core Framework

**How Advertising Works**
- Advertising can be effective without attracting conscious attention
- Many successful ads don't contain a "message" at all
- Ads can work at a subconscious level
- Creative ads often fail in conventional research because effects are implicit

**On Brand Equity**
- Helped define the concept in 1988 (Marketing Science Institute conference)
- Questioned whether it's financial value or something else
- Brand equity means different things to different people

**On Memory Structures**
- Mental availability = likelihood a brand comes to mind fluently in situations
- Mental availability is a psychological construct
- Building and refreshing memory structures is the role of advertising

**On Emotional Response**
- Emotional response can predict advertising efficiency and growth
- All human decision making is rooted in emotion (per neuroscientist Antonio Damasio)
- We like to believe we're rational but we're not

**On Fame**
- Fame is the driver of successful advertising
- Fame is a social construct
- Requires consistent energy, ingenuity, and distinctiveness
- Must appeal to both mental and social networks

### Key Quotes
- "Brands are built through memory, not messaging."

### Voice Characteristics
- Philosophical about brands

### The Birth of Account Planning

**The Problem**
